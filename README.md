# Symbaroum Companion

A static web app for managing characters and inventory for the Symbaroum RPG. Open `index.html` to browse items and `character.html` to manage a character sheet locally in your browser.

## Export/import of characters

Use the **Exportera** button in the filter panel to copy a short code representing the current character. Codes are compressed and only contain references to the builtâ€‘in database. The **Importera** button lets you paste such a code to recreate the character (requires that the database is loaded).
